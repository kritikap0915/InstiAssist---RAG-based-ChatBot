# 🎓 InstiAssist: Your Institute's RAG-Based AI Assistant

InstiAssist is an intelligent chatbot designed to provide real-time, accurate information about an institution by leveraging its internal documents and resources. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to go beyond the limitations of pre-trained models, ensuring that all answers are grounded in the provided institute-specific data.

### ✨ Features

  - **Accurate & Contextual Answers:** Provides responses based strictly on the institution's documents, preventing "hallucinations" common in Large Language Models (LLMs).
  - **Scalable Knowledge Base:** Easily ingest new institutional data (e.g., PDFs, CSVs, text files) to expand the chatbot's knowledge.
  - **RAG Architecture:** Combines the power of an LLM with a retrieval system to find the most relevant information before generating a response.
  - **Persistent Memory:** Uses a vector database (ChromaDB) to store and retrieve data efficiently, making the system fast and responsive.

-----

### ⚙️ How it Works

The chatbot follows a standard RAG pipeline:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The `database.py` script ingests all relevant institute documents (e.g., from the `Topic Modelling Dataset 2.csv`) and processes them.
2.  **Chunking & Embedding:** The documents are broken down into smaller, manageable chunks. These chunks are then converted into numerical representations called embeddings using a pre-trained embedding model.
3.  **Vector Store:** The embeddings are stored in a vector database, **ChromaDB**. This database is optimized for fast and efficient semantic search.
4.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, the chatbot's system queries the ChromaDB to retrieve the most semantically similar text chunks from the institution's documents.
5.  **Generation:** These retrieved text chunks, along with the user's question, are fed as context into a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM then generates a final, coherent answer based *only* on the provided context.

### 📂 Project Structure

  - `app.py`: The main application file that runs the chatbot interface.
  - `database.py`: Handles the data ingestion, chunking, embedding, and vector database creation (ChromaDB).
  - `chromadb/`: The directory where the ChromaDB vector store is persisted.
  - `Topic Modelling Dataset 2.csv`: The primary dataset containing information about the institution.
  - `topic modeling.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis and topic modeling on the dataset.
  - `requirements.txt`: A list of all necessary Python libraries for the project.
  - `readme.md`: This README file.

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

  - Python 3.8 or higher.
  - A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kritikap0915/InstiAssist.git
    cd InstiAssist
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Running the Application

1.  **Ingest the data and set up the vector database:**
    Before running the chatbot, you need to set up the ChromaDB. Run the `database.py` script to process the institute data.

    ```bash
    python database.py
    ```

    This script will create the `chromadb` directory and populate it with the embedded data from `Topic Modelling Dataset 2.csv`.

2.  **Start the chatbot:**
    Now, you can run the main application.

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    This will launch the chatbot interface, allowing you to ask questions about the institution.

### 📊 Topic Modeling & Dataset

The `topic modeling.ipynb` notebook was used to analyze the dataset (`Topic Modelling Dataset 2.csv`). This analysis helps in understanding the primary subjects and themes within the institutional data, which can be useful for refining the data ingestion process or for future feature enhancements.
